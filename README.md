# Kopi

*Kopi* is a high-level webapp framework written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

It brings rapid development experience to client side which Rails and Django does on server side.

## We love jQuery

Kopi used [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (or [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) which provides jQuery-compatible API for mobile browsers) as low-level library.

## Modular JavaScript with AMD

Components are implemented as AMD compatible modules.

Kopi also provides a [Python](http://python.org/) script to concatenate all scripts together in the order they were required if you don't use any module loader.

## Object-Relational Mapper

Class-based data models. MongoDB-style query interface. Model adapter for various databases like IndexedDB, LocalStorage, RESTful service.

## URL-based Navigation

## Touchable UI Components
